Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of softwa Engineeriing.

1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering
  - This landmark event highlighted the growing "software crisis" and led to the recognition of software engineering as a distinct discipline focused on systematic development practices.

Adoption of Structured Programming and the Waterfall Model in the 1970s
  - The introduction of structured programming techniques and the waterfall model established a sequential, phase-based approach to software development, improving project management and software reliability.

Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming in the 1980s
  - Object-oriented programming introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and modularity, enabling developers to build more complex, scalable, and maintainable software systems.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.  

1. **Requirement Analysis** – Gather and define the software requirements based on user needs and business goals.  

2. **Planning** – Outline the project scope, resources, timeline, and budget to ensure smooth development.  

3. **Design** – Create the system architecture, database structure, and user interface to serve as a blueprint for development.  

4. **Development (Implementation)** – Write and implement the actual code based on the design specifications.  

5. **Testing** – Identify and fix errors, ensuring the software functions correctly and meets requirements.  

6. **Deployment** – Release the software for users, either in phases or all at once, depending on the strategy.  

7. **Maintenance & Support** – Continuously update, fix bugs, and enhance the software based on user feedback and evolving needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriateate.

1. **Approach**  
   - Waterfall follows a linear, step-by-step process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.  
   - Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing continuous adjustments throughout development.  

2. **Flexibility**  
   - Waterfall is rigid and difficult to change once a phase is completed.  
   - Agile allows frequent changes based on user feedback and evolving requirements.  

3. **User Involvement**  
   - Waterfall involves users mainly at the beginning during requirement gathering.  
   - Agile engages users continuously throughout the development process.  

4. **Delivery**  
   - Waterfall delivers the final product at the end of the process.  
   - Agile delivers functional increments in short cycles (sprints).  

**Best Use Cases**  
   - Waterfall is best for well-defined projects with stable requirements, like government systems or medical software.  
   - Agile is ideal for projects with evolving requirements, like mobile apps and customer-driven web applications.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Example of a Vague Prompt**  
*"Tell me about technology."*  

**Improved Prompt**  
*"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market in the next five years."*  

**Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective?**  
1. **More Specific** – Focuses on AI rather than broad "technology."
2 **Clear Objective** – Asks about AI's impact on jobs.
